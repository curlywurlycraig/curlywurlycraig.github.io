    <h1>Syntax highlighted text editor</h1>

    <div id="demo">
        <p>
            There's a demo of a little syntax-highlighted text editor here if you enable JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            I understand not wanting to run JavaScript on the modern web. My
            JavaScript respects you! There's no tracking, there are no
            dependencies, I wrote all the JavaScript. The bundle size is small.
        </p>

        <p>
            But if you don't want to enable JS, you can still read a bit about
            how I made this <a href="/posts/hiccup">here</a>.
        </p>
    </div>


<p>
I needed a really small text editor (in terms of bundle size) for an in-browser
video game I'm working on. I want the game to load very fast even on poor
internet connections, and I have found that as soon as you open the dependency
flood-gates your bundle size grows enormously.
</p>

<p>
Challenging myself to not use any dependencies also means being forced to learn
a lot more than you would otherwise, since you can't just import parsers, DOM
utilities, and so on. You have to do it yourself and learn something along the
way. And who knows, maybe you'll end up writing something better than what you would
have imported.
</p>

<h2>Tokenising</h2>

<p>
Tokens for the editor are identified using a set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">parser
combinators</a>.
</p>

<p>
They look like this:
</p>

<div class="code-container">
  <pre><code><span class="parsed_KEYWORD_CONST">const</span> string = <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">or</span>(
    <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">sequence</span>(
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseCharacter</span>(<span class="parsed_STRING">'"'</span>),
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">maybe</span>(<span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseWhileChar</span>(c =&gt; c !== <span class="parsed_STRING">'"'</span>)),
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseCharacter</span>(<span class="parsed_STRING">'"'</span>)
    ),
    <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">sequence</span>(
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseCharacter</span>(<span class="parsed_STRING">"'"</span>),
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">maybe</span>(<span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseWhileChar</span>(c =&gt; c !== <span class="parsed_STRING">"'"</span>)),
        <span class="parsed_FUNC_CALL">parseCharacter</span>(<span class="parsed_STRING">"'"</span>)
    )
);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
The nice thing about parser combinators (over something like regex) is that they
are readable and composable. Creating entirely new language parsers is easy by
combining combinators differently. They're also fast, but I haven't benchmarked
them against regex.
</p>

<p>
  You can see all of the other combinators used in the above text editor <a href="parse/parser.js">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Hiccup</h2>

<p>
  The remaining work to produce an interactive text editor on the basis of the
  parser combinators is some utilities to patch changes to the DOM using a
  simple representation.
</p>

<p>
  I used hiccup for the reasons outlined <a href="/posts/hiccup/">in this post</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Well, I can use it in my game without shipping megabytes of JS to users. I
can also use it for blogging purposes: I can use the above with different parser
combinators and then simply copy the inner HTML of the resulting code
element and paste into the source. That's how I generated the code block showing
what the parser combinators look like without requiring JS at all (try this page
without JS).</p>
