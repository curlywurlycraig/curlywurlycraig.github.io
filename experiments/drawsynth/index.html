      Synthesis takes place in a wasm file compiled from C (without Emscripten!).

      WebAudio is a little weird given that its primitive is the
      node. What I ultimately want is just a buffer of samples I can
      write to. This setup is the nearest thing to that world and does
      allow me to just do what I want in C and write a bunch of floats
      to a buffer.
