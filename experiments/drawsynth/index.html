      Synthesis takes place in a wasm file compiled from C (without Emscripten!).
      
    <p>

      WebAudio is a little weird given that its primitive is the
      node. What I ultimately want is just a buffer of samples I can
      write to. This setup is the nearest thing to that world and does
      allow me to just do what I want in C and write a bunch of floats
      to a buffer.

    <p>

      This works by creating
      an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletProcessor">AudioWorkletProcessor</a>
      and just reading from
      a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer">SharedArrayBuffer</a>.

    <p>

      There are some pros and cons with this approach. It is very
      simple and performant to share memory this way, since the main
      thread can make changes to the memory (such as when you edit the
      waveform) directly instead of having to pass messages and so on.

    <p>
      However, <span class="code">SharedArrayBuffer</span>s present <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements">a security concern</a> which may affect browser support if not carefully considered.

    <p>
      I'm still experimenting with the best approach for this kind of
      audio programming. Maybe
      the <span class="code">AudioWorkletProcessor</span> should
      initialise the WASM instead, and
      accept <span class="code">AudioParam</span>s when configuration
      is changed instead. This would result in some overhead for
      passing messages between the main thread (where user interaction
      takes place) and
      the <span class="code">AudioWorkletProcessor</span>, but this probably
      won't make a meaningful enough effect on audio processing
      performance to be a problem.
