      <p>I'm Craig Wilkinson, a software engineer with a lot of web experience but with personal interests in many areas.</p>
      
      <p>Here (and on my <a href="https://github.com/curlywurlycraig">Github</a> profile) you will find some, but not all, of the many projects I have worked on. Many of these projects are unfinished, abandoned, or written in an unusual way.</p>
      <p>The projects here vary across language and domain but all in general were created so that I could explore some particular idea.</p>
      <p>If any of these projects piqued your curiosity, gave you an idea, or elicited any kind of response (except disgust) whatsoever then I consider my contributions to the open source community a success.</p>
      <p>Happy hacking</p>
