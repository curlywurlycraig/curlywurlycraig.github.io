    <h1>A small problem with my drawsynth and how to solve it</h1>

    <p>
      To be honest, this post is largely an excuse to experiment with
      having multiple canvases on the same page, as well as loading
      WASM code from inside
      an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletProcessor">AudioWorkletProcessor</a>.
      
    <p>
      In <a href="/experiments/drawsynth/">drawsynth</a>, I presented
      the ability to allow a user to draw the waveform for a
      synthesizer. It worked by storing an output buffer in a C
      array which was copied every 128-sample frame in
      an <span class="code">AudioWorkletProcessor</span>.

    <p>
      I like this approach for its speed and flexibility. Using a raw
      array buffer from C allows literally any digital signals
      processing technique to be used at a performance about as high
      as is possible on the web.

    <p>
      The solution so far has one important drawback: it cannot be
      played at a different pitch. This is because the output buffer
      is a fixed 128-sample frame. It is impossible to play a tone at
      a different fundamental frequency<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a> because the same waveform is
      always played at the same rate.

    <p>
      Consider the following sine wave:

      <div>
	<canvas class="example_1" width="400px" height="200px" alt="A sine wave" />
      </div>

    <p>
      It is easy to imagine the wave oscillating on into the future
      beyond the right hand side of the box, but this is not what is
      happening. If we draw two samples, we see that the sample is
      just duplicated:

      <div>
	<canvas class="example_2" width="800px" height="200px" alt="A sine wave, raggedly joined on to another sine wave" />
      </div>

    <p>
      That strange tooth in the middle is the problem. It's even easier to see the effects of this problem when we adjust the frequency (hover to animate).

      <div>
	<canvas class="example_3" width="800px" height="200px" alt="An animating sine wave, raggedly joined on to another sine wave" />
	</div>

    <p>
      The solution to this problem is for the oscillator defined in C to offset the phase with the appropriate amount every frame.
