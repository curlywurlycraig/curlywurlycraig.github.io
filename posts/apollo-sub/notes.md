# Outline

## Introduce what I was trying to do (graphql subscriptions in deno)

## Describe the current state

TODO Investigate and discuss fragmentation, lack of formalisation of the "handshake" process
TODO introduce subscriptions-transport-ws.

## Describe subscriptions-transport-ws in detail

TODO Try to semi-formalise how the handshake process works, including images

We can ignore
