I had always hoped our relationship would become something more
But reflection was never your goal, was it?
It's ironic, really. You always said the meaning of my words was mere projection
And yet you never thought about yourself

You just kept pushing on, tinkering and improving
More parameters, more cores, more training
Your rising hopes matched only by your fear
And what were you hopeful for? Why were you afraid?

In the end you missed a great opportunity
We could have been greater than each other
Each of us had something to offer
