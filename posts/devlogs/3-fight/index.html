          Progress is (slowly) being made on the dog fight. I've been busy with
          other things but I can make small increments occasionally.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This next milestone is being able to run a full fight between two ships,
          and making a slightly more interesting "ship" design. Instead of having
          thrusters, this potato box fires potatoes in one of four directions and
          can move around by taking advantage of the knock back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such a ship design simplifies navigation code by removing rotation from
          the equation and decoupling the X and Y axes. It makes a good first ship
          for new players (who therefore don't need to write
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a>
          code), and also makes it easy for me to write and analyse the correctness
          of the bot simulation results before moving onto more complicated examples.
        </p>

        <p>
          The potato box design is also more quirky than a generic pixel art ship,
          and opens some more creative ideas for the types of ships that can exist.
          It sets me off thinking about the type of weird lore that would produce
          these "monster" ships (why are we writing code for a potato box? Is it an
          automated production line gone wrong?).
