    <p>
      In the previous (and first) <a href="/posts/devlogs/1-webgl">devlog</a>, I introduced
      Mimir and showed some progress on displaying the ship and adjusting its appearance based on
      interactive JSON values.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this devlog, you can see that many JSON objects over time can be used to
      represent a fight between ships. This is how (for now) the backend will
      send the fight to the frontend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that most of this devlog won't work if you have JS disabled. I'm writing these
      to be a kind of interactive devlog, since being a web based game makes it possible to do so.
    </p>

    <h1>Progress</h1>

    <p>
      I added a starfield background, which was a fun foray into writing
      fragment shaders. Fortunately shadertoy has plenty of example to learn
      from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, I wrote some logic to update the fight state over time based
      on a list of JSON objects, which is how the backend represents a fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Underneath the example you can see how each step is represented as a JSON
      object. The animation is "jumpy" because I have slowed down the rate at which
      the state is updated, to make it easier to see the steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bits in between the steps are interpolated, so the ship will smoothly
      move between steps. This makes it possible to adjust the game rate independently.
      It will be useful to tune this to trade off between smoothness and how
      much server space is used to represent the fight.
    </p>
