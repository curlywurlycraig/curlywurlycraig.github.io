    <h1>Codename Mimir devlog 1: Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Codename "Mimir" (not final name) is a programming game in which you
      program robots to fight in a dogfight arena. You use a choice of
      programming language to write the <code class="inline">tick()</code>
      function, in which you observe the environment and activate
      thrusters/weapons and so on.
    </p>

    <h1>Progress</h1>

    <p>
      So far, the backend is working, and I'm getting there on the frontend part.
      I've created a syntax-highlighted
      <a href="/posts/experiments/text-editor">text editor</a>
      and begun work on the graphics:
    </p>

    <canvas id="canvas-textured-squares"></canvas>

    <p>
      Above is mainly to get used to using shaders and WebGL, which I was
      unfamiliar with. Tying this together with my previous work on
      <a href="/posts/experiments/text-editor">a syntax highlighted text editor</a>
      is easy. Edit the following JSON to change the ship's angle, health and position:
    </p>

    <div id="editor"></div>
    <canvas id="canvas-json-driven-ship"></canvas>

    <p>
      Hooking this up to the data sent from the backend will be straight forward.
