    <h1>Codename Mimir devlog 1: Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Codename "Mimir" (not final name) is a programming game in which you
      program robots to fight in a dogfight arena. You use a choice of
      programming language to write the <code class="inline">tick()</code>
      function, in which you observe the environment and activate
      thrusters/weapons and so on.
    </p>

    <h1>Progress</h1>

    <p>
      So far, the backend is working, and I'm getting there on the frontend part.
      I've created a syntax-highlighted
      <a href="/posts/experiments/text-editor">text editor</a>
      and begun work on the graphics:
    </p>

    <canvas id="canvas-textured-squares"></canvas>

    <p>
      Above is mainly to get used to using shaders and WebGL, which I was
      unfamiliar with. Tying this together with my previous work on
      <a href="/posts/experiments/text-editor">a syntax highlighted text editor</a>
      is easy. Edit the following JSON to change the ship's angle, health and position:
    </p>

    <div id="editor"></div>
    <canvas id="canvas-json-driven-ship"></canvas>

    <p>
      While this might not look like much, it demonstrates the composition of a
      few different milestones: a text editor, and state that is based on
      contents of the editor (granted this will actually come from the dogfight
      updates from the server, but it's good to have the two things related in
      this demo), and some basic graphics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hooking this up to the data sent from the backend will be straight
      forward. Next changes are going to be to add a nice health bar, thruster
      graphics, laser/cannon graphics, background graphics (maybe), and hooking up
      to a kind of "timeline" state (lines of JSON) which emulate how the
      dogfight updates are sent from the backend.
