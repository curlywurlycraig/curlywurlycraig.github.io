ELI5 that they won't drop the bombs

Just explain it to me please. That it's all going to be ok in the end and we aren't all going to wake up tomorrow dead because of bombs. Hold me like your own sweet child and tell me that ain't gonna happen. That there in actual fact is no real danger from the bombs. The temparatures aren't going to just rise and rise and rise until we can't get rice or beans or pears anymore and that the bananas and the bees and all the insects won't go exctinct. Tell it to me as if you were consoling one of your very own dear children. That death is a long way away and not like basically something on the next page of for example the calendar in my kitchen. And ultimately that it's just what the news is like, that it's maybe just like the media equivalent of a pelham tone, it just feels hectic and bad all the time and ever worsening but actually if you just look out your window you can essentially see smiling people going out to get maybe for example an IPA and a pulled pork sandwich at a local brewery. That's just an example. I just want you to ELI5 about how none of any of that is going to come to pass or come and affect me in a way that makes my death something to consider or imminent and so on. The pulled pork by the way is OK to eat, environmentally speaking, right? Just explain that to me like what is basically an infant who ought not to be spending much of their mental resources considering total outright human extinction from an avoidable cause. Your actual biological baby boy that you joyfully brought home from the hospital on the day of his birth in his blankets still moist from the process of birth. I'm just a scared helpless baby but it's all going to be sorted out by adults. That's what I'm here to ask you to explain to me, is the way in which it will be sorted out. Not in any great complicated detail but in a way that just takes that fear away because the explanation sounds perfectly adequate and convincing.
