Picture the depths of space, or something like it. An infinite void. In the void exists a sort of walkway, infinitely long. The walkway has an undetermined material, but it is maybe a bit like glass. It is just wide enough for a ball to roll on. The ball rolls forwards along the walkway. There is gravity here. The ball absolutely must not roll off the walkway. Under no circumstances. We are doing OK right now so long as the ball is on the walkway. Though we may be a little apprehensive about the ball falling off, at least it hasn't actually fallen off. That is the truly hellish scenario in which all is lost. Let's really focus here to prevent that. Keep the ball on track. There's no safe zone of any kind for the ball to reach, so we can never be truly comfortable or hopeful about an improvement in our circumstance but we have every reason to be uncomfortable. Because we know _it can get so much worse_. Keep it steady, the ball. Moving but steady. Easy there. It's fine for now.
