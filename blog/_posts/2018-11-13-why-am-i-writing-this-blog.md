I am beginning to hate computers. It wasn't always like this. In fact, I used to
think they were brilliant things. You could open a text editor and make them do anything, and co-operate with other people on forums trying to make mods for Half-Life or their own side scrollers. I remember when I first discovered programming and I'd be glued to the computer screen until my parents would threaten to take the computer away.

And it's not like there aren't many things that are still great about them, it's just that my life has slowly been changing in a way that exposes me to a side of computers that erodes my soul.

So much of our interaction with technology has become an unpleasant struggle against the competing desires of others and we're laden with tracking cookies and ads to finance the battle. Not to mention the sometimes-impossible-to-find-on-mobile popups to let us know as much.

This is a way for me to provide myself, and any curious enough to look, a place to enjoy technology and use it to make more sense of this world.
