        This website is my little reclaimed corner of the real and actual fun
        internet. That is, as a collective expression of information of various
        forms, linked together with <span class="code">&lt;a&gt</span> tags.
      </p>

      <p>
        The internet has for a long time been strongly moving towards watered
        down, corporate friendly, and overly "social" spaces that are anathema
        to creative expression and individuality. I have contributed to this
        atmosphere in a variety of ways, and have largely forgotten what the
        internet actually is. Or what it used to be. Or what it has the
        potential to be.

        There is plenty of good writing on this topic (such as <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2025/07/03/the-rise-of-whatever/">The rise of Whatever</a>)
        so here I'll just stick to my contributions. I plan to add a few posts
        about interesting things I'm up to in this internet reclamation sphere.
        Right now I'm interested in self-hosting some stuff, especially by
        resurrecting old devices and repurposing them for semi-functional and
        semi-artistic uses.
